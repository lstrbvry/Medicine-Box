			First day, Implemented chekcbox and simple designs, aiming to make a
			minimum viable product as quick as possible. Connecting checkboxes to
			objects representing the medicines. With only a single major category of
			signs, succesfully implemented envisioned functionality. Using hash,
			removed duplicates from results
		</p>
		<p>
			Second day, trying to implement functionality with more than 1 majors, and
			medicines repeating throughout different majors. Problem: how to know
			which medicine code to compare to which major signs checkbox code, because
			values are store in nested arrays. Solved desperately using arrays and a
			LOT of loop. On hindsight, should have used a key:value syntax. Added
			styles to the result for better experience. Filled up Medicine object
			properties.
